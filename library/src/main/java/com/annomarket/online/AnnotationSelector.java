/**
 * Representation of a single annotation selector expression. An
 * annotation selector is a combination of annotation set name and
 * annotation type. Either or both of the parts is optional - if the
 * annotation set name is omitted then this selects the default
 * annotation set (which has no name in GATE), and if the annotation
 * type is omitted then all annotations from the relevant set are
 * selected. So in particular if <em>both</em> parts are omitted, the
 * result is a selector that selects all annotations from the default
 * set.
